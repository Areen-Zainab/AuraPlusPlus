**WorkSphere**

An Integrated HR and Project Management System


**Scope:**

 Our project focuses on delivering a comprehensive HR and project management platform to cater to the needs of companies, employees, and clients. Our main focus is on the following areas:
 
➔ Human Resources Management

➔ Project Management

➔ User Interaction

➔ Reporting and Analytics


**Domain:** For the foreseeable future, this project will be limited to Aura++ - a tech conglomerate. 

The scope of this software lies in facilitating this company with Human Resources (HR), Project Management, and - most importantly, in a tech-based world - Business Process Automation. This scope is particularly relevant for businesses to manage teams, work on multiple projects simultaneously, and for users to collaborate with companies to complete their projects efficiently.

Previous Tools: Our project will be modeled off of ClickUp's core functionality - but it will take it a step further by incorporating complete company HR management.


**Objectives:**

★ Streamline HR and Project Management by automating processes like employee onboarding, role assignment, and project tracking.

★ Enhance User-Company Collaboration and Transparency by enabling seamless communication, project proposal submissions, milestone updates, and real-time progress tracking.

★ Centralize Resource and Data Management for easier access to employee information, project resources, and financial data in one platform.

★ Support Data-Driven Decision Making by providing reports and analytics on employee performance, project status, and resource allocation.

★ Enable Self-Service HR Functions for Employees such as updating personal information, submitting leave requests, and tracking attendance without needing HR intervention.


**Problem:**

Modern businesses often struggle to manage employee details, project assignments, and tracking progress efficiently across different platforms. This causes bottlenecks in operations, resulting in reduced productivity, and delayed or inadequate project deliverables.

Clients, on the other hand, encounter difficulties in submitting projects and maintaining track of updates. Limited transparency and manual processes lead to frustration and slow project timelines. These issues severely undermine productivity and lead to dissatisfaction for both involved parties - clients and companies.


**Solution:**

Our proposed system addresses these challenges by integrating human resources and project management into a unified platform, allowing seamless collaboration between companies and users. For companies, it will handle everything from managing teams, allocating resources, and monitoring the human resources of the organization. It will also allow employees to access, and
remain up-to-date with work-related information.

For users, the software provides a system where they can find companies, submit project proposals, and monitor the progress of their projects through real-time updates. Users can communicate with companies, review the project timeline, and provide feedback upon completion. The system ensures a seamless interaction between users and companies, improving efficiency, transparency, and collaboration.
